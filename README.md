# Subnational political actors and socialisation in European institutions

The purpose of this project is to document the data processing, statistics, and regression models used in the research paper. 

The language is R, and the main notebook is structured as an R markdown file.

The data folder contains the necessary dataset, the plots folder contains the produced figure, and the reports folder contains the html and pdf outputs of the R markdown file.
